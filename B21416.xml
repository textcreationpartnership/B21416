            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <p>HIs Maje≈øty's late Injunctions are the Subject of the following Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe: How wi≈øe they are in them≈øelves, and how ≈øuitable to the Exigencies of the Church, is vi≈øible to any one, who is never ≈øo little acquainted with the Di≈øputes of the pre≈øent Age. The <hi>Socinians</hi> by oppo≈øing the Belief of the Holy <hi>Trinity,</hi> and the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, having brought Religion into Danger, there appear'd Writers of all ≈øorts to defend the Grand and Common Concern of Chri≈øtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. But they being Men of different Education, Studies, and Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, manag'd the Sacred Controver≈øie in a different way from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Some excellently vers'd in Eccle≈øia≈øtical Learning, and great A≈ø≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, as well as Judges of <hi>Tradition,</hi> ≈øtuck firmly to the Deci≈øions of the Sacred Councils, and the Determinations of the Fathers: Some addicted to the Speculations of the Schools, follow'd a more ab≈øtru≈øe and metaphy≈øical Method: Others us'd to a Philo≈øophical way of arguing, would bring our My≈øteries within the u≈øual and receiv'd Principles of rea≈øoning. But all this was not done with the ≈øame Abilities and Succe≈øs. Some made the Judgment of the Catholick Church before, and after the great Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> to appear with a va≈øt Clearne≈øs and Evidence: Some did ≈øhew to the learned World, how Grapes may be gather'd of Thorns; and the manner of ≈øpeaking of the Schools become not only plain, but al≈øo florid, and eloquent: Others thought that God had stamp'd in us the Image of his incomprehen≈øible Operations: <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>nhappy in this, that they gave to weak Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes the Name of Demon≈øtrations, and justly anger'd the pre≈øent, by ridiculing the Terms us'd by the Ancient Church.</p>
            <p>This, though indeed well de≈øign'd of all hands, yet met not with all the Succe≈øs which might have been hop'd for. It inflam'd the <hi>Socinians,</hi> and made them not ≈øo much to weigh the Truth it ≈øelf, as to ≈øtrive to find ≈øome De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in every one of the≈øe ways. The fir≈øt being mo≈øt Matter of Fact, was very hard to be oppos'd; and who≈øoever reads ≈øeriou≈øly the An≈øwer to the learned Doctor <hi>Bull,</hi> and is in any degree acquainted with Antiquity, mu≈øt needs wi≈øh for more Exactne≈øs and Candor in the Author of that Writing. The ≈øecond they have profe≈ø≈øedly mi≈øunder≈øtood, owning Dr. <hi>South</hi> as exact and as clo≈øe a Writer as ever was, to ≈øpeak the Sence of the Church, but willing to mi≈øtake that Sence, and confounding it with <hi>Sabelliani≈øm,</hi> which the Church ever did, and does now dete≈øt. The third having given them great Advantages, they have crowded one Print upon the neck of another, and the Authority of the Divine Oracles laid a≈øide, Philo≈øophy becomes the Judge of Religion; and <hi>Ari≈øtotle</hi> or <hi>Des Cartes</hi> impeach Chri≈øt and his Apo≈øtles.</p>
            <p>But this is not all: Several learned Men among≈øt us could not bear with
<pb facs="tcp:193432:3"/> the≈øe new Notions, or think their Silence ju≈øtifiable to God and his Church in this Matter: They exprest them≈øelves warmly again≈øt tho≈øe <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>ncatholick Terms and Explications, but were an≈øwer'd again with Heat and Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; and a War began of a ≈øtrange and unaccountable Nature; all Parties agreeing in the ≈øame De≈øign to maintain our Holy My≈øteries, and yet divided in the way of pur≈øuing it.</p>
            <p>The Injunctions obviated all this, by giving a check to a ≈øwarm of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian</hi> Prints, which with great Industry were di≈øper≈øt over the Kingdom; and obliging Divines not only to treat the≈øe Sacred Matters calmly, but al≈øo to u≈øe no other Expre≈ø≈øions in their Explications, but what the Churches of God have us'd them≈øelves to: A wi≈øe and a truly Chri≈øtian Expedient to pre≈øerve the Peace and <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>nity of the Church! For of all the Societies which make up the Catholick Church, none ever pretended to ≈øay any new thing in this Matter; but as they receiv'd the Faith, ≈øo they deliver'd it to us: And to any rational Man, it is a mighty Argument again≈øt <hi>Sociniani≈øm,</hi> that tho≈øe very Churches which have, and do differ among≈øt them≈øelves in ≈øo many other Points, never differ'd in this; and that the great Variety of Super≈øtructures never in the lea≈øt affected the Foundation.</p>
            <p>I hope that this has in a very great mea≈øure laid the Heats rais'd among≈øt us: But it has not ≈øilenc'd the <hi>Socinians;</hi> th√¥ indeed it appears to me by their late≈øt Prints ≈øince the publi≈øhing of the Injunctions, that they write more out of a de≈øire to have it ≈øaid, that they have left no Book un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an≈øwer'd, than really to ≈øatisfie them≈øelves and others concerning tho≈øe ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtantial Arguments, which have been offer'd to them. This is the mo≈øt cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Con≈øtruction which I can make of the An≈øwers to Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> the Lords Bi≈øhops of <hi>Sarum</hi> and <hi>Chiche≈øter,</hi> and the incomparable Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Lord Bi≈øhop of <hi>Worce≈øter.</hi> But I think the An≈øwer to my Book to be a ≈øingular In≈øtance of this. A Friend of mine, who is a Gentleman of that Per≈øwa≈øion, had often told me that there was one coming, and I expected it with ≈øome Impatience, de≈øirous to ≈øee what they had to ≈øay to ≈øome plain Arguments, which I thought of great force, and how they would vindicate ≈øo many Places out of their own Books, which they own'd I had cited with a great deal of Truth and Ju≈øtice. At la≈øt my Friend ≈øhews me their late≈øt Collection of An≈øwers, among≈øt which there is one <hi>to the four Letters of M. H. de L.</hi> I hope it will not be taken ami≈øs if I make ≈øome Remarks upon it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is very diverting to ≈øee a Writing call'd an An≈øwer to the four Letters; and not ≈øo much as a Page, or Line, or Tittle of the four Letters touch'd. I confe≈øs that this is an ea≈øie way of an≈øwering, and that at this rate any Book upon Earth may be an≈øwer'd. Any Body may have the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure to be an Author. But I am not altogether ≈øatisfied, that this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtent with that reputation of Learning and Eloquence which the≈øe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb facs="tcp:193432:4"/> men have ≈øo ju≈øtly acquir'd. One or two more ≈øuch An≈øwers, will, I am afraid, ≈øink, or at lea≈øt endanger a part of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They give a rare rea≈øon for not meddling with the four Letters. <hi>I know not,</hi> ≈øays the Author, <hi>p.</hi> 47. <hi>whether we are concern'd in them, till I know more certainly in what Sence he holds a Trinity of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Per≈øons, and the Divinity and Satisfaction of our Saviour?</hi> I beg leave of the≈øe Gentlemen to a≈ø≈øert, that they know as well as I do my ≈øelf, what is my ≈øence in tho≈øe Matters. Ob≈øcurity is none of the many defects which the four Letters may be charg'd with: But they were not willing to intangle them≈øelves in the di≈øcu≈ø≈øion of ≈øo many Citations, or to make good the weak ≈øide of their Writings, which they were ≈øen≈øible could not be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd. They have found of late a ≈øhorter Cut; and that is, the famous di≈øtinction <hi>of Real and Nominal Trinitarians:</hi> They ≈øteal away with this on all occa≈øions, and ≈øtill maintain a running Fight: It is their la≈øt refuge; and had it not been for the rare contrivance, there had been before this an end of the <hi>Socinian</hi> Controver≈øie. To an≈øwer a ≈øolid Argument, is a hard, and generally an unfortunate Task: But if they can but bring you right or wrong within the Verge of the fatal Di≈øtinction, then they have always a large Field for Di≈øcour≈øe: They act in this like ingenious, but whether altogether like con≈øcientious Men, I am not willing to determine?</p>
            <p n="3">3. They are ≈øo full of that beloved di≈øtinction, and ≈øo fond of meeting with any thing that looks like it, that in what they call an An≈øwer to the <hi>Four Letters,</hi> they have done to them≈øelves and to me a real Injury. To them≈øelves by a flat contradiction in the ≈øpace of four Pages; and to me, by charging me with that which I never ≈øaid or thought: They make me ≈øay that the Divine Per≈øons are Three Infinite Spirits. Pag. 43. <hi>He ≈øays Three Infinite Spirits each of them a God, are all of them but One God:</hi> I averr that there is nothing in the <hi>Four Letters</hi> which directly, or indirectly looks like that: It is not the Language of Scripture, nor that of the Catholick Church: It never was, and I hope ≈øhall never be mine. But this they have contradicted, <hi>Pag.</hi> 47. by de≈øiring to know, <hi>in what Sence I hold a Trinity of Divine Per≈øons.</hi> One would be apt to ≈øay that this betrays a great deal of Incogitancy.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>Four Letters</hi> then are ≈øtill ≈øound and ≈øafe; but the Preface is engag'd, and I mu≈øt endeavour to bring it off. Two things in it are excepted again≈øt: The one, that I ≈øaid, <hi>That the Con≈øent of the whole Chri≈øtian World mu≈øt be a ≈øtrong Inducement to a mode≈øt <hi>Socinian</hi> to mi≈øtru≈øt all his Arguments, and that to oppo≈øe all that is great and good in the Church of God in a Point of Faith,</hi> which Word the Author of the An≈øwer has overlook'd, <hi>is too much for the mo≈øt pre≈øuming Di≈øputant.</hi> He ≈øays to this, <hi>p.</hi> 40. <hi>that the ca≈øe is this; one ≈øide has Argument, the other has Authority and Number: And that in a Cla≈øh between Argument
<pb facs="tcp:193432:4"/> and Number, that whole World, and all that is great in it, when weigh'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt but one Argument, is as if you had put nothing at all into the Scale.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ≈øay that he ab≈øolutely mi≈øtakes the Ca≈øe. We maintain that the Church has Rea≈øon, as well as Authority and Number; and that on this very Account a mode≈øt <hi>Socinian</hi> mu≈øt lo≈øe much of his Confidence. By all that is great and good, I mean the Sacred Councils, the Holy and Learned Fathers, and the different Societies of Chri≈øtians all the World over, who have been baptiz'd in the Name of that Ble≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed Trinity, and look upon <hi rend="blackletterType">Ie≈øus Chri≈øt</hi> as the Author and Fini≈øher of their Faith. In a Point of Faith, and much le≈øs in the Foundation, God will not ≈øuffer the Catholick Church to err. Had I ≈øaid that it had been a <hi>Rea≈øon</hi> to a mode≈øt <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian</hi> to mi≈øtru≈øt all his Arguments, I had ≈øaid nothing but what is exactly true: I confe≈øs I was too mode≈øt my ≈øelf in calling it only an <hi>Inducement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. The other Exception is again≈øt an A≈ø≈øertion, which I thought no Divine in the World would have di≈øputed; That Faith and Rea≈øon are two different things; and, con≈øequently, that that which is the Object of Faith, cannot be the Object of Rea≈øon. He calls this, <hi>p.</hi> 41. <hi>a very ra≈øh Propo≈øition.</hi> He ≈øays ≈øome lines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>That the Apo≈øtle teaches, <hi>Heb. 11.1.</hi> not only that the Object of Faith and Rea≈øon is the ≈øame; but that there cannot be Faith without Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon; and that Faith is the Product of Rea≈øon.</hi> This Author ≈øhould have con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, before he call'd <hi>the Propo≈øition ra≈øh,</hi> that it is the Sence of all the Ancient and Modern Divines; and that th√¥ ≈øometimes Faith and Rea≈øon are conver≈øant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ≈øame Object; as for in≈øtance, in the Exi≈øtence and <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>nity of God, which Rea≈øon con≈øiders as well as Faith; yet for all that, their Object is different, and even in this very ca≈øe, Rea≈øon a≈ø≈øents to it, as it is naturally known; and Faith, as it is ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturally reveal'd.

            <p n="6">6. This Gentleman asks me ≈øeveral Que≈øtions, wherein I mu≈øt take the liberty to tell him that I am not at all concern'd, and con≈øequently not oblig'd to an≈øwer. He argues very ≈ømartly again≈øt Three Infinite Minds, Spirits, or Sub≈øtances; th√¥, at the ≈øame time, I doubt he makes his Adver≈øaries to ≈øay more than really they do. I leave him and them to di≈øpute it; yet one of them I think is a Que≈øtion by no means to be offer'd, and takes off much of the re≈øpect due to the Sacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, <hi>p.</hi> 42. <hi>This therefore,</hi> ≈øays he, <hi>is the fir≈øt Que≈øtion that I de≈øire Mr. <hi>L.</hi> to re≈øolve: Will he believe a Doctrine that ≈øeems to imply manife≈øt and inconte≈øtable Contradictions, if ≈øuch Doctrine or Propo≈øition were indeed found in Scripture?</hi> To this, I an≈øwer, that the Que≈øtion is unrea≈øonable, becau≈øe the Suppo≈øition on which it is grounded is impo≈ø≈øible. God cannot contradict him≈øelf. A manife≈øt and unconte≈øtable Contradiction in Scripture, is a thing not ≈øo much as to be thought of from him, who is Light, and in whom there is no Darkne≈øs at all. But I well go farther with this Gentleman; and th√¥ I love and honour Rea≈øon as much as any Man in the World, yet I will affirm, that if it were po≈ø≈øible that in any undoubted Scripture there ≈øhould be in clear and expre≈øs Terms a Propo≈øition or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which ≈øeems to imply a manife≈øt and inconte≈øtable Contradiction, I ought not to reject it, or make my Rea≈øon the Judge of God's Veracity: But my Duty is humbly to re≈øign my ≈øelf to him, and adore what I cannot under≈øtand.</p>
            <p n="7">7. I know that this Gentleman will take this very ill; and will ≈øay again, as he has already, <hi>p.</hi> 41. that <hi>I calumniate Rea≈øon, the Light ≈øet up in us by God him≈øelf.</hi> But that Light is not given us to impeach and reproach our Maker; and reject what he commands us to believe, or call it <hi>a manife≈øt and inconte≈øtable Contradiction,</hi> becau≈øe it is above its weak Perceptions: That Light ought to act in its due mea≈øure and proportion; if it goes farther, it is a Rebellion and an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt again≈øt the Maje≈øty and Power of God. He calumniates Rea≈øon, who does detract from its Dignity and Energy in tho≈øe things wherein it ought to be Judge. It is an Affront to Rea≈øon to be brought below it ≈øelf: But he al≈øo calumniates Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, who exalts it more than it de≈øerves; as he no le≈øs maliciou≈øly injures a Man, who commends in him Qualities which he has not, than he who ob≈øcures and denies tho≈øe which he has. There are ≈øome General Principles wherein Rea≈øon cannot err, and which Man ought to be guided by. None is more plain and evident than this, that he owes his ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion and a≈ø≈øent to what God propo≈øes: Whether it be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen≈øible, or not comprehen≈øible, is no part of the Inquiry? Whether God has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd it, is the true ≈øtate of the Que≈øtion? Rea≈øon has a Right to examine, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God has propos'd it, or no? The danger of taking things upon Tru≈øt, is too great to deny Rea≈øon the power of examining. But that Point once clear'd, to ≈øay that we ought not to ≈øubmit, becau≈øe it is incomprehen≈øible, or appears to us manife≈øtly contradictory, is an ill and an endle≈øs way of arguing.</p>
            <p n="8">8. This Author cannot dige≈øt the Epithets of <hi>Narrow</hi> and <hi>Corrupt,</hi> which I gave to Rea≈øon. He complains of it in ≈øeveral places of his ≈ømall Writing. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is not our Rea≈øon ≈øuch? Can he who denies this, pretend that he ever endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
<pb facs="tcp:193432:5"/> to know him≈øelf? I have often wonder'd at the pains which ≈øome Men have taken to convince the Oppo≈øers of the Doctrine of Original Sin. The ≈øhorte≈øt and ea≈øie≈øt Method was to ≈øend them to them≈øelves, to find there the fatal con≈øequences of the fir≈øt Tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion. I appeal to my ingenious Adver≈øary, who th√¥ certainly a great Ma≈øter of Rea≈øon, yet upon ≈øecond Thoughts will agree with me that the Rea≈øon of the be≈øt Men is very Narrow and Corrupt. Whence do proceed ≈øo many Mi≈øtakes and Errors, Mi≈øapprehen≈øions and Inadvertencies, but from that very Principle? Is not this the Spring of ≈øo many hot and tedious Di≈øputes? And what Rea≈øon but this can be given of ≈øo many Books and Opinions which have divided Mankind?</p>
            <p>In this the Excellency of Faith appears, and for this we ought to prai≈øe its Author, the <hi rend="blackletterType">Holy Ie≈øus,</hi> that it has rectify'd and improv'd Rea≈øon not only by making it more knowing, but al≈øo more humble, more ≈øincere, and more obedient to God.</p>
            <p>I am ≈øure that this is the Method of arguing of the Primitive Fathers in that mighty ≈øtruggle with the Heathen Philo≈øophers, ≈øome of whom did ≈øo exalt Rea≈øon as to pretend to decide of every thing; whil≈øt others did ≈øo revile it, as to be po≈øitive that nothing could certainly be known; and con≈øecrated that wild and extravagant Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Socrates, Hoc unum ≈øcio nihil ≈øcio.</hi> This I know that I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Both di≈øputed admirably one again≈øt another. But when the Apologi≈øts for Chri≈øtianity were oblig'd to take in hand the Cau≈øe of Religion; alth√¥ they had the true Notion of Rea≈øon, <hi>Res Dei Ratio,</hi> ≈øays elegantly <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and knew it to be the Light of God in us, yet they own'd it to be <hi>narrow</hi> and <hi>corrupted,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequently not Rea≈øon, but Faith and Revelation to be attended to. Thus <hi>Ju≈øtin Martyr, Arnobius, Tertullian, Lactantius,</hi> St. <hi>Au≈øtin,</hi> and others: <hi>Tertullian</hi> de Anima, c. 1. <hi>Cui enim veritas comperta ≈øine Deo? Cui Deus cognitus ≈øine Chri≈øto? Cui Chri≈øtus exploratus ≈øine Spiritu Sancto? Cui Spiritus Sanctus accommodatus ≈øine Fidei Sacramento:</hi> And St. <hi>Au≈øtin de morib. Eccl. Cath. c.</hi> 2. A Book never enough to be read; who ≈øpeaks of Rea≈øon in Terms which mu≈øt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly plea≈øe tho≈øe Gentlemen, calling it, <hi>Per≈øpicuitas, &amp; ≈øanctitas Rationis,</hi> the <hi>Clearne≈øs and Sanctity of Rea≈øon;</hi> yet ≈øays, that it is ≈øo much ob≈øcur'd by Sin, Pa≈ø≈øion, and Prejudice, that, <hi>Saluberrime comparatum e≈øt, ut in lucem Verita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis aciem titubantem, &amp; velut ramis humanitatis opacatam inducat authoritas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. This ≈øhews how much this Gentleman is in the wrong, when he ≈øays, <hi>p.</hi> 42. that <hi>I mu≈øt be content to argue the≈øe Que≈øtions about the Trinity and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation not from Scripture only, but from Rea≈øon al≈øo; nay, from <hi rend="blackletterType">Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon chiefly and ultimately.</hi>
               </hi> As far as Rea≈øon is ≈øub≈øervient to find the Truth and Certainty of the Revelation, I confe≈øs that I mu≈øt argue from Rea≈øon; and the <hi>Chiefly and ultimately</hi> is capable of a good Sence; becau≈øe the belief of our My≈øteries is at la≈øt re≈øolv'd into this mo≈øt rational Propo≈øition, That I mu≈øt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what God has reveal'd; and that to find that it is ≈øo in the ≈øacred and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Scriptures, is certainly the Work of Rea≈øon. But if he means that, the Authority of God's Word laid a≈øide, we mu≈øt bring tho≈øe My≈øteries to the Scrutiny of Rea≈øon; and in≈øtead of Divine, u≈øe only Humane and Philo≈øophical Di≈øcepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb facs="tcp:193432:6"/> I ≈øay that it is a new, an unrea≈øonable, and an unchri≈øtian A≈ø≈øertion.</p>
            <p>It is new: For this very Author is too much conver≈øant with Antiquity, not to know, that in the long Conte≈øts between the <hi>Orthodox,</hi> and the <hi>Arrians, Ne≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> &amp;c. the Scripture was appeal'd to on both ≈øides: They never thought of pretended Impo≈ø≈øibilities, <hi>manife≈øt and inconte≈øtible Contradictions.</hi> The Certainty of the Revelation, was the only proof aim'd at; That the Scripture plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taught it, was affirm'd by the Church; That it was not, was maintain'd by Hereticks. Indeed Tradition had a ≈øhare in the Di≈øpute: For no Scripture being of private Interpretation, the Sence of the Primitive Doctors was strictly inquir'd after; but all ≈øtill was re≈øolv'd into the Te≈øtimony of God in the Sacred Writings. Yet the≈øe Times had their Orators, their Philo≈øophers, their Criticks; and it is ≈øtrange, that none of them could perceive, that one, and one, and one, are not one but three; and that <hi>this manife≈øt and inconte≈øtable Contradiction</hi> ≈øhould only be a di≈øcovery of the <hi>Socinians</hi> in this Age.</p>
            <p>It is al≈øo unju≈øt and unrea≈øonable: For the manner of treating a Di≈øpute, mu≈øt have ≈øome proportion with the thing in Di≈øpute. Phy≈øical Experiments are not ≈øearch'd into with Metaphy≈øical Speculations; nor metaphy≈øical Speculations clear'd by Phy≈øical Experiments. Critici≈øms are un≈øerviceable in Geometry, and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Geometrician may be a lamentable Critick. Yet we have to deal with a ≈øort of Men, who will have Rea≈øon to decide of Matters above Rea≈øon; will make Faith and Rea≈øon, knowing and believing to be the ≈øame thing; and under pretence of Rea≈øoning, will rob God of his Power over us, and us of the Reward of our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him.</p>
            <p>It is unchri≈øtian. If you de≈øign to di≈øpute with a Philo≈øopher, then go and ran≈øack <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Rome;</hi> out with your Rea≈øon as ≈øplendidly, and profu≈øely as you can: But for me, who can ≈øay with <hi>Pacianus, Chri≈øtian is my Name, and Catholick is my Surname,</hi> I can, I will hear nothing but out of the Sacred Scriptures: What≈øoever you intend to teach me of God, mu≈øt be fetch'd from thence. I never built the hopes of my Salvation upon <hi>Ari≈øtotle,</hi> or <hi>Des Cartes:</hi> Their Writings are good in their kind; but to form Religion, they are tho≈øe Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øterns ≈øpoken of by the Prophet, <hi>broken Ci≈øterns that can hold no Water.</hi> In a Word, there we are to fix; and we cannot avoid di≈øputing eternally, if this is not made the Touch stone of all our Arguments. When we have indulg'd our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon to the utmo≈øt degree, it will prove an egregious Cheat to us, and we ≈øhall at la≈øt be oblig'd to return whence we came, and ≈øay as St. <hi>Au≈øtin,</hi> Epi≈øt. ad Volu≈ø. <hi>Dandum Deo aliquid po≈ø≈øe, quod fateamur nos inve≈øtigare non po≈ø≈øe.

This is the fir≈øt Shield of Faith, which the Church oppos'd to the early Attempts of tho≈øe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:193432:8"/> Hereticks who thought to have ≈øtifl'd her in her Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. This Confe≈ø≈øion of <hi>God the Father, of his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son Je≈øus Christ our Lord, and of the Holy Spirit,</hi> which is the Sub≈øtance of that Creed, made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øucce≈øsful the Endeavours of <hi>Simon, Cerinthus, Ba≈øilides, Menander, Carpocrates,</hi> and the ≈øwarm of impure <hi>Gno≈øticks.</hi> By this every Chri≈øtian was initiated to Religion, gave a rea≈øon of the Hope that was in him; and became a Member of that Society here on Earth, which after per≈øeverance in well doing is to be rewarded in Heaven.</p>
            <p>I know that a Critick of this Age, a Per≈øon of the fir≈øt rank in the Common-wealth of Learning, has di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted both the Antiquity and Univer≈øality of this Creed. A Notion too unadvi≈øedly taken up by ≈øeveral Authors, who thought that the <hi>Socinians</hi> took too great an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from the Simplicity of its Articles. He made it to be only a Creed of the Latin or We≈øtern Church, which the Catechumens were taught before their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion to Bapti≈øm. He produces two of St. <hi>Irenoeus,</hi> three of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> one of St. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi> three of <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> and in≈øi≈øts on ≈øome difference even between the Fathers who have been the Expo≈øitors of this Creed, St. <hi>Austin, Chry≈øologus, Maximus,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>But notwith≈øtanding all this, who≈øoever will look into the Creeds of St. <hi>Irenoeus,</hi> and <hi>Tertullian;</hi> for that of St. <hi>Cyril</hi> was after the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, and tho≈øe which <hi>Ruffinus</hi> has compar'd, that is, the <hi>Roman,</hi> the <hi>Aquileian,</hi> and the <hi>Oriental</hi> Creeds, will find ≈øo mighty an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the variations ≈øo minute and incon≈øiderable, as to make impo≈ø≈øible any ≈øub≈øtantial difference.</p>
            <p>And it is certainly a ≈øtrange Fancy, that the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> ≈øhould take an advantage from the Simplicity of the≈øe Articles, which being but a Compendium of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:193432:8"/> New Te≈øtament, are at la≈øt re≈øolv'd into it. For the Sence of that Creed mu≈øt be that of the Scriptures, of which it is an <hi>Epitome.</hi> And how can they argue again≈øt the Divinity of <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> and of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> from their not being call'd God in the Creed, when the Scriptures are ≈øo full in a≈ø≈øerting the Unity of God, and the Trinity of Per≈øons in that one Adorable and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature? Are we not baptiz'd <hi>in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit? Are there not Three that bear Record in Heaven, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,</hi> and <hi>are not the≈øe three one?</hi> Is not <hi>Christ</hi> declar'd to be, <hi>God ble≈ø≈øed over all for ever?</hi> and <hi>God manife≈øted in the Fle≈øh?</hi> Are we not told that <hi>the Spirit ≈øearches all things, even the deep things of God,</hi> and that <hi>to lye to the Holy Spirit, is to lye to God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Objection is of that Clearne≈øs and Evidence, is ≈øo far from giving them any Advantage, and they have found them≈øelves ≈øo pre≈øs'd by it, that they have been forc'd to ≈øplit on another Rock, and ≈øay that the Form of Bapti≈øm is no part of Scripture, and is only an addition to St <hi>Matthew.</hi> That the Place of St. <hi>John</hi> is another, and that the Word <hi rend="blackletterType">God,</hi> is not to be found in the cited Scriptures. Shifts unbecoming learned Men!

It is not in the Power of the Church to make new Forms, new Articles of Faith: And in this the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is inexcu≈øable, and guilty of a Schi≈øm, which ≈øhe has charg'd others with. But to declare and explain the Faith, is an e≈ø≈øential part of its Power. The growing Here≈øies were the occa≈øion of the Apo≈øtolical Creed, the fir≈øt Remedy apply'd to that raging Di≈øea≈øe.

               </gap>, the vain and noi≈øie Oppo≈øitions of a pretended Knowledge, oblig'd them to deliver the ≈øacred Sy≈øtem of Divine Verities. But when the old Hereticks were worn out, leaving to the World a ≈øad remembrance of their gro≈øs Follies and Immoralities; and a new ≈øort ≈øprung up, who did attempt to overthrow the Faith once deliver'd to the Saints by Bla≈øphemous Heterodoxies.

            <p>And indeed it would have been very happy for the Church, if Men keeping to the Plainne≈øs and Simplicity of the Revelation, had not pre≈øum'd to go farther. Oh, that an humble Faith had ≈øtifl'd Curio≈øity in its fir≈øt At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to inquire into Divine My≈øteries with weak Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiocinations, and Philo≈øophy never a≈ø≈øum'd to bring Divinity to be try'd at the Bar of humane Rea≈øon! Then <hi>Mercy and Truth would have ki≈øs'd each other, and God, even our God, would have given us his Ble≈ø≈øing.</hi> But Man forgot that <hi>≈øcrutator Maje≈øtatis opprimetur √† Gloria,</hi> That the bold and daring Searcher into the Maje≈øty of God will be oppre≈øs'd and ≈øink under the weight of his Glory.

            <p>God has reveal'd to us his Exi≈øtence and the Unity of his Nature.

            <p>I am apt to think that it will give a great Light to what I have to ≈øay on this head, if I endeavour to ≈øhew before-hand which ways we depart from it.

            <p>The fir≈øt has been done by the Hereticks already mention'd. The unfortunate Attempt has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd by <hi>Socinus,</hi> and his Followers; but by none ≈øo wholly, as by a ≈øort of pretended witty People, who a≈øham'd of the <hi>inhumane</hi> and irrational Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øion of <hi>unmanly Athei≈øm,</hi> have under the Name of <hi rend="blackletterType">Dei≈øts</hi> endeavour'd to explode all reveal'd Religion.

            <p>The ≈øecond, that is to keep to the Article, but put it in other Words, has been done by ≈øome among≈øt our ≈øelves. Whether this has been the Effect of a too much indulg'd Curio≈øity, or of an imprudent Zeal: Whether the Heat of the Di≈øpute, and the pre≈ø≈øing Efforts of the Enemy has driven them from their Anchors? Whether they have been too fond of the Offspring of their own Brains; or whether a mixture of all the≈øe together has been the occa≈øion of it, is difficult to judge: But it is certain that the Pre≈øs has groan'd under the burthen of new Di≈øcoveries; brought forth a ≈øwarm of An≈øwers and Replies fuller of Heat than Light; and made it nece≈ø≈øary for the Peace of the Church, that a Curtain
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:193432:11"/> ≈øhould be drawn over abundance of Writings, where Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Mode≈øty, and Candor ≈øhould have had a greater ≈øhare than really they can pretend to.</p>
            <p>Of the fir≈øt of the≈øe, it is ea≈øie to ≈øhew, how dangerous it is to depart from the Form of ≈øound Words. For what greater danger can we fall into, than <hi>to make Shipwrack concerning the Faith?</hi> A State ≈øo much the more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, becau≈øe it de≈øtroys the very ground of our hopes. For <hi>he that believes ≈øhall be ≈øav'd<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> He that does not believe is condemn'd already.</hi> To differ from an Orthodox Church, of which we are Members, tho in point of Ceremony, is very ≈øinful, if the difference is carry'd ≈øo far as to make a Schi≈øm: Toleration, tho' it ≈øecures us from the Laws of Men, not acquitting us at all in the ≈øight of God. But how much deeper is that Guilt, which lays the Ax to the Root of the Tree; and having corrupted our Minds, <hi>makes us reprobate concerning the Faith?</hi> An Enormity which the be≈øt and earlie≈øt Ages ≈øhew'd their dete≈øtation of by their frequent <hi>Anathema's</hi> again≈øt it.</p>
            <p>But of the ≈øecond, it does not ≈øeem ≈øo ea≈øie to pronounce. For if Men in the Fundamental Articles of our Holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion keep really, and unfeignedly to the truth of what is propos'd, as in the Trinity and Incarnation; ≈øhall we quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with them for u≈øing ≈øuch Words as are either unknown to Antiquity, or rejected by the Doctors of the pre≈øent Church? May not God reveal to us what the Fathers of <hi>Nice</hi> or <hi>Chalcedon</hi> were ignorant of? And as long as we own the Sub≈øtance of the Article as ≈øtrictly as our ≈øtricte≈øt Oppo≈øers, can any Fault be found with any Explication?

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, It un≈øettles pious Minds.</hi> New Explications are like <hi>Meteors,</hi> which ≈øet Men on gazing, and always por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Ruine to Religion.

            <p>No An≈øwer can be made to this, but a pretence of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øity, that the <hi>Socinians</hi> have made it unavoidable in their Di≈øputes again≈øt the ble≈ø≈øed <hi>Trinity</hi> and <hi>Incarnation,</hi> to run on a new Method; and that St. <hi>Au≈øtin</hi> has taught us, and before him St. <hi>Cyprian;</hi> and of their Words a Canon has been made, That <hi>Melius e≈øt ut ≈øcandalum oriatur quam Veritas relinquatur.

            </p>
            <p>But where does the Nece≈ø≈øity appear? Are we not ≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible, that the Arguments again≈øt our My≈øteries are neither new nor invincible?

            <p>It fills learned Men with Grief and Indignation to ≈øee ≈øome of our late Authors ≈øtrive to entangle an Elephant in a Spider's Web, and expect the lamentable I≈ø≈øue of their Proceeding, who, as <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great expre≈ø≈øes it, <hi>lib.</hi> 6. <hi>mor. c.</hi> 17. <hi>Wanting Humility to be Di≈øciples of the Truth, become at la≈øt the Patrons of Error.</hi> The Eccle≈øia≈øtical Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtory ob≈øerves that the Great <hi>Ba≈øil</hi> of <hi>Seleucia,</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Nazianzum,</hi> before they offer'd to exerci≈øe their Epi≈øco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Function, did give them≈øelves for thirteen years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the Retirement of a private Life, to the Study of the Holy Scriptures. <hi>Illarum ≈øententiam non ex proprio in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genio, ≈øed ex majorum ratione &amp; authoritate interpretantes.</hi> Not interpreting them as they pleas'd, ≈øays the Hi≈øtorian, but conforming their Interpretations to the Sence and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Ancients.

            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, It cannot be done without giving the Adver≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries a mighty Advantage.</hi> By Adver≈øaries I mean all the Oppo≈øers of the ≈øacred Truths: But mo≈øt particularly the <hi>Socinians;</hi> of whom it mu≈øt be acknowledged, that in their fir≈øt Prints they manag'd this Controver≈øie in a dull and langui≈øhing ≈øort of a way; and were really at a lo≈øs, till
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:193432:14"/> the unwary manner of writing of ≈øome among≈øt us, ≈øet them again on a full Cry, and made them more eager and vehement. Till then, their Objections were ≈øtale, and their An≈øwers to ours ≈øtrain'd and unnatural. But ≈øome mu≈øt pretend to explain things inexplicable, and under≈øtand things incomprehen≈øible. The <hi>Socinians</hi> ≈øen≈øible of the Advantage, remove all their Batteries, and place them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt that weak ≈øide; and what work they were like to have made, if more accurate Writers had not ≈øtept in, learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men ≈øee and grieve. Only di≈øingenuous in this, that when they have expos'd a Writer, they think to have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome the Church; as if the Church did warrant all their Inadvertencies, who pretend to write in her Defence; or e≈øpou≈øe private Notions, which ≈øhe never knew, nor ever will own.</p>
            <p>This eminently appears in one of their late≈øt Prints, call'd <hi>A Di≈øcour≈øe concerning the Real and Nominal Trinita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.</hi> This they take to be the lucky hit. If you believe them, the Church is made up either of <hi>Trithei≈øts,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally a≈ø≈øert three Gods; or of <hi>Sabellians,</hi> who mean no more by three Per≈øons, than three meer Modes or Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and this Notion they have carry'd ≈øo far, and ≈øo throughly per≈øwaded them≈øelves of the Truth and Strength of it, that it has ≈øwallow'd up all their other Topicks. Whereas there never was perhaps a more unju≈øt way of arguing in the World: For the Church is ≈øo far from being divided into ≈øuch Real and Nominal Trinitarians, as they are pleas'd to repre≈øent us, that there is no ≈øuch thing in Nature. There is no Church, or part of the Church, which believes any more than one Infinite and Eternal God. There is no Church, or part of the Church, which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver plac'd the Trinity of Per≈øons in meer Modes, Relations, Names, or Offices. There is no Church, or part of the Church, but what has admitted a Real Unity in Trinity, and a Real Trinity in Unity, but has declar'd the <hi>Modus,</hi> or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to be altogether incomprehen≈øible.</p>
            <pb n="17" facs="tcp:193432:14"/>
            <p>But where then have the <hi>Socinians</hi> met with a ground for this bold A≈ø≈øertion? Truly from ≈øome unhappy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øions of Men, who have not been judicious and exact e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ≈øee all the Con≈øequences which flow from their Principles; and have not perceiv'd that an Adver≈øary could not be oblig'd to be ≈øo equitable, as not to carry tho≈øe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequences further than ever they were intended. The <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians</hi> did hear ≈øome talk of Three Infinite Minds and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; an Expre≈ø≈øion indeed har≈øh and new! And an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Mind, or Spirit, being the definition of God, they have concluded that they a≈ø≈øerted Three Gods. But they have not had the Ju≈øtice to con≈øider, that they who a≈ø≈øerted Three Infinite Minds and Spirits, a≈ø≈øerted them in one altogether indivi≈øible and in≈øeparable, that is, in a Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical Nature. On the other ≈øide, they have heard that the Three Per≈øons were the ≈øeveral Modes, and Relations of the Divine Nature. They pre≈øently run upon the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Modes in created Beings, which are only the ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Affections of Sub≈øtances; and concluded that ≈øuch a ≈øort of a Trinity is only of Modes and Denominations: But they have not had the Ju≈øtice to con≈øider that the <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>Modes of Sub≈øi≈øtence,</hi> are quite of another Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; That what≈øoever is in God, is God; That the Sub≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtences and Relations are all ≈øub≈øtantial; and that the Church never pretended, nor the≈øe Authors them≈øelves, that they could give any adequate repre≈øentation of an Object incomprehen≈øible.</p>
            <p>In the mean time they have made a diver≈øion; heated ≈øeveral great and learned Men one again≈øt another; and by equally mi≈ørepre≈øenting both, have given us a ≈øad In≈øtance how dangerous it is to depart from the Form of ≈øound Words.</p>
            <p>I draw now to a Conclu≈øion; and come to ≈øhew, how we ought to behave our ≈øelves in relation to them who have departed from it. Our behaviour mu≈øt be limited by ≈øo many ≈øeveral Rules, as there are Per≈øons who have done it.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:193432:15"/> Fir≈øt, Tho≈øe without, who have departed from the Article it ≈øelf. Secondly, Tho≈øe within, who have departed from the Terms which the Church expre≈ø≈øes it by.</p>
            <p>The only Adver≈øaries of the Sacred Doctrine in this Age, are the <hi>Socinians.</hi> I humbly conceive, that that part of the Injunctions which concerns the Angels of the Church, the mo≈øt Reverend the Archbi≈øhops and Bi≈øhops, is no part of our bu≈øine≈øs: We mu≈øt not pre≈øume to pre≈øcribe to them from whom we ought to receive Laws: They are the Principle of Order and Unity in the Church: They are Stars of the fir≈øt Magnitude, and in that Elevation of Zeal and Knowledge, that as they ≈øee farther, and move in a far larger extent than we do; ≈øo they cannot be wanting to them≈øelves, when grievous Wolves enter in among≈øt us, not ≈øparing the Flock. I confine my ≈øelf to us, who, by the Tru≈øt committed to our Care, may come to be engag'd in the≈øe Di≈øputes.</p>
            <p>Of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> ≈øeveral are Per≈øons of Learning and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience, acquainted with all the fine ≈øort of Literature, and who have done for and in a bad Cau≈øe as much as Men can do: It is an Honour to the Church to have ≈øuch Adver≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to deal with. Truth never appears with more force, than when it is mo≈øt ≈øtrongly oppos'd. In our late Di≈øputes again≈øt <hi>Popery,</hi> a ≈ømall Stock of Learning and Common Sence was enough to ≈øhew its Folly. In the wrangling War with the Di≈ø≈øenters, we have been forc'd to argue with a ≈øort of Writers who ≈øcarce under≈øtood good Language. But in this, we meet with a ≈øubtil and ≈øtrong Enemy, well fitted with all Materials for War; and I look upon it as a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, who turns all things to the good of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, that this Controver≈øie will put us of the Clergy upon finer, better, and more comprehen≈øive Studies.</p>
            <p>But there is another ≈øort of <hi>Socinians;</hi> and they are they who pretend to make a Bu≈øtle in the World; Men, who, after a long cour≈øe of Athei≈øm and Debauchery, come at
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:193432:15"/> la≈øt to think of Religion; not becau≈øe they de≈øign to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øue the ends, or ≈øubmit to the Duties of it, but becau≈øe in an Age where ≈øo many Religions are allow'd, it is not hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øome to be without one. They live ≈øtill as they did before, with as little care as ever of their Eternal Concerns; but think Religion only to con≈øi≈øt in talking at randon of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Matters. The≈øe Heroes ≈øcorn to fall upon ≈øome part of the Di≈øcipline and Liturgy of the Church, as other Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals have done, but pre≈øently impeach its Faith, its Articles; ≈øtare Mankind in the face; and with that mouth us'd before to bla≈øpheme and reproach their Maker, they dare to deny the Lord that bought them. Every Club, Coffee-hou≈øe, or Tavern, is the Scene of the Tragedy; and Religion, the mo≈øt ≈øerious and grave bu≈øine≈øs of Man's Life, the Exerci≈øe of the Church, Family, or Clo≈øer, is villainou≈øly pro≈øtituted over a Di≈øh of Coffee, or a Bottle of Wine.</p>
            <p>The way to deal with the≈øe, is not to di≈øpute: An evil heart of Unbelief has turn'd them a≈øide, that they cannot ≈øay there is a Lye in my right hand: They are to be the Object of our Prayers, and Tears to God for their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øion. The la≈øt Argument that remains, is by our good Examples to bring them to ≈øome Sence of Morality.</p>
            <p>But again≈øt the others, we ought to di≈øpute and to write: When Error is always ready to ≈øpeak, Truth ought not to be ≈øilent. We cannot be afraid of a Cau≈øe, which the Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Company of the Apo≈øtles has taught, the Noble Army of Martyrs maintain'd, and the Holy Church throughout all the World ≈øo ≈øolemnly acknowledg'd. But it is diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be ob≈øerv'd, that few Rea≈øons, and the≈øe good; Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, and the≈øe not conte≈øted; an exact and accurate way of writing, are the means to ≈øtop a Controver≈øie. Above all things, Heat and Pa≈ø≈øion ought to claim no part in the Di≈øpute: Ill Language is a bad Introduction for the be≈øt Argument. Either we de≈øign to confute, in≈øtruct, and per≈øwade them, or we do not: If we do not, we detain
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:193432:16"/> the Truth of God in Hypocri≈øie, and make it ≈øub≈øervient to mean and inglorious Ends: And if we do, we cannot but be ≈øen≈øible, that Truth, Gravity, Exactne≈øs, and Strength of Rea≈øon, are ≈øtrangely ob≈øtructed by a ≈øordid and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious way of writing.</p>
            <p>But if we are to be ≈øo ju≈øt to them without, how much more to them within? It is one of the Exce≈ø≈øes which God reproaches the Wicked with, <hi>P≈ø.</hi> 50.20. <hi>to ≈øit and ≈øpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt his Brother, to ≈ølander his own Mother's Son.</hi> A Sin not allowable in the Jewi≈øh, much le≈øs in the Chri≈øtian Church; not pardonable in a Laick, much le≈øs in a Clerk. It has been ob≈øerv'd of the old <hi>Romans,</hi> that they ≈øcarce ever felt any Convul≈øion in their State, till their victorious Arms were turn'd again≈øt them≈øelves, and de≈øtroy'd in very few years the Pro≈øperity of many Ages. It has appear'd all along, our Adver≈øaries them≈øelves being Judges, that the great Piety, mighty Genius, va≈øt Parts, profound Learning, and flowing Eloquence of the Clergy of this Nation, has made the Church of <hi>England</hi> venerable to all the World: They have brought the Clamouring Papi≈øt to ≈øhame and de≈øpair of Succe≈øs: They have ≈øilenc'd the buzzing Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformi≈øt. No Argument has fallen into their hands, but what they have exhau≈øted with an incredible Felicity of Thought and Expre≈ø≈øion; and mu≈øt we turn tho≈øe never foil'd Weapons into our own Bowels? Is this a time to become the Contrivers of our own ruine, whil≈øt the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my takes breath, and has nothing left to do, but to inflame our unhappy Contentions?</p>
            <p>I am not for ≈øtifling the Truth. God forbid! It would be in vain; for it is great, and it mu≈øt prevail. I would have Zeal to take its cour≈øe, and our mouth to be open, and our heart enlarg'd to all Men: But at the ≈øame time I would have fervent Charity among≈øt our ≈øelves; and think it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øufferable to bite and devour one another, till we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øum'd of one another.</p>
            <pb n="21" facs="tcp:193432:16"/>
            <p>To avoid ≈øo dangerous an Exce≈øs, let us take leave of our Pa≈ø≈øions when we begin to ≈øpeak or write about the≈øe Sacred Matters. Pa≈ø≈øion hinders us from taking the real Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of an Argument, and makes us to admini≈øter Poi≈øon in≈øtead of a Medicine. It generally puts us on the wrong ≈øide of the Que≈øtion; and the <hi rend="blackletterType">Man</hi> does ≈øadly expo≈øe the Writer. It has the ≈øame Effect on him again≈øt whom we write: It hurries him to a retaliation; and between two hot Spirits, Truth vani≈øhes, and only the wrangling part remains. It is that which we abhor in Conver≈øation, and is not ≈øuffer'd among≈øt civiliz'd People. We wrangle in Print, and ≈øtamp on Paper the la≈øting marks of Fury and Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice. In the mean time the Judicious Reader pities Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Weakne≈øs; wants a ≈øtock of Patience to read the Book through, and leaves us at la≈øt to the Judgment of the great Judge. But a judicious Reader is ≈øomewhat rare. The loo≈øe witty People ≈øwallow greedily the ≈øarca≈øtical, and leave the ≈øerious part. By this Religion is expos'd, and cruelly mi≈ørepre≈øented. This has been the ground of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Canons taken from the grave Admonitions of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and in particular the 53 of our Church.</p>
            <p>Let us unanimou≈øly return to the Form of found Words. That which ≈øhews the Vanity and Unpracticablene≈øs of Explications beyond the Power of Contradiction, is, that there is none but what is liable to invincible Objections; and indeed how can it be otherwi≈øe, when the Subject tran≈øcends all our Apprehen≈øions? Man who is ≈øcarce ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him≈øelf, will pretend to decide of the Nature of God! A poor, finite, and limited Being, will become a Judge of Eternity, and Immen≈øity!
